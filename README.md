Web page
And it is special mention that I have done all the coding things in one single file.
since it was a easy website so it is made in one file but if you are developing lengthy website prefer all the things seperately and then merge it.Seperately means you should create HTML,CSS page seperately.


myfirstwebpage.php is considered as index.php

--->after signup you need to login and database will fetch your information and will check it
whether it is correct or not
And if it will correct the submit button will bring you to name.php

-->here in the file babua12.php I have included all the information of database. 
Like database username=root password="" and after that babua12.php contains
the information about database name,table name,no. of coloumns etc..
