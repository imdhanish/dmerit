web page
And it is special mention that I have done all the coding things in one single file.
since it was a easy website so it is made in one file but if you are developing lengthy website prefer all the things seperately and then merge it.
myfirstwebpage.php is considered as index.php
after signup you need to login and database will fetch your information and will check it whether it is correct or not
And if it will correct the submit button will bring you to name.php
